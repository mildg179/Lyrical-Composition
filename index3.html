            Driving out into the sun <br>
            the ultraviolet cover me up<br>
            Went looking for a creation myth<br>
            Ended up with a pair of cracked lips<br>
            Windows down, scream along<br>
            To some America first rap, country song<br>
            A slaughterhouse, an outlet mall<br>
            Slot machines, fear of God<br>
            Windows down, heater on<br>
            Big bolts of lightning hanging low<br>
            Over the coast, everyone's convinced<br>
            It's a government drone or an alien spaceship<br>
            Either way, we're not alone<br>
            I'll find a new place to be from<br>
            A haunted house with a picket fence<br>
            To float around and ghost my friends<br>
            No, I'm not afraid to disappear<br>
            The billboard said, "The end is near"<br>
            I turned around, there was nothing there<br>
            Yeah, I guess the end is here<br>
            The end is here<br>
            The end is here<br>
            The end is here<br>
            <div class="container2">
                <span class="text4">The end is here.</span>
