        <p>Somewhere in Germany, but I can't place it <br>
        Man, I hate this part of Texas <br>
        Close my eyes, fantasize <br>
        Three clicks, and I'm home<br>
        When I get back I'll lay around<br>
        And I'll get up and lay back down<br>
        Romanticize a quiet life<br>
        There's no place like my room<br>
        But you had to go<br>
        I know, I know, I know<br>
        Like a wave that crashed and melted on the shore<br>
        Not even the burnouts are out here anymore<br>
        And you had to go<br>
        I know, I know, I know<br>
        Out in the park, we watch the sunset<br>
        Talking on a rusty swing set<br>
        After awhile you went quiet, and I got mean<br>
        I'm always pushing you away from me<br>
        But you come back with gravity<br>
        And when I call, you come home<br>
